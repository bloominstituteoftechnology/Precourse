      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <span id="instructions">
        In this assignment we are going to use the display, position, and flex box properties 
        to position our elements correctly on the page. Please put all of your CSS in the CSS 
        file "homework.css". "homework.css" should be the only file you touch, if you find 
        yourself altering the homework.html or dontTouch.css files, you are in the wrong area. 
        You will need to use the class, id, and element selectors from lesson 2.
      </span>

    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise One:</h3>
      <span id="exerciseOne">
        Your first exercise will be to make sure the text within this &lt;span&gt; is centered 
        on the page. The id of this span is "exerciseOne". Text has a unique positioning system 
        known as "text-align" we can set this to 'left', 'right', 'center', or 'justify'(stretches each 
        line to fit the width of the container), but this only works for a block elements  
        and &lt;span&gt; is initially an inline element. Set this span's display property to be 
        a block element and center the text using text-align.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Two:</h3>
      <span>
        There is a box at the top of the screen. That was just supposed to be a placeholder until 
        we got the title of this lesson locked down. Unfortunately we do not have access to the HTML, 
        so we can not manually remove it. Using CSS only, make sure the box is not displayed. 
        The id is "exerciseTwo".
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Three:</h3>
      <span>
        Below you will see a box, inside of it is an image, we want to make the image appear in the red box.
        You will need to change the position attribute, and then adjust the image accordingly. The red box is 
        100px from the top and 200px from the left. The id of the image is "exerciseThree".
      </span>
      <div id="moveBoxContainer">
        <div id="targetContainer"></div>
        <img id="exerciseThree" src="./assets/tiger.jpeg" />
        <div id="descSpan">
          <span>This is an image of an animal, you can see the animal here. There are lot of animals in the world, and this is one of them. I hope you enjoy this image of an animal!</span>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Four:</h3>
      <span>
        The blue rectangular box below is supposed to be our header bar, it should be anchored to 
        the upper left corner of the page, and should not move when the page is scrolled. The id for 
        the box is "exerciseFour". Change the position, so that the box is in the upper left hand corner. 
      </span>
    </div>
    <div id="exerciseFour">
      <div id="exerciseFive">
        <span>Pre-Course Lessons</span>
        <img src="./assets/lambdawhite.png" />
        <span>Lambda School</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Five:</h3>
      <span>
        There are three items in the header bar, "Lambda School", the Lambda School logo, and 
        "Pre-Course Lessons". Using the id of "exerciseFive", we will make the container they are in 
        a flex box, we want to make sure that the space between each item is exactly the same, and we want 
        each of the items to appear centered vertically on the line.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Six:</h3>
      <span>
        Now that the items in the header bar are spaced properly, they are out of order. "Lambda School" 
        should be on the left, and "Pre-Course Lessons" should be on the right. Using the same id from the last exercise, 
        change the direction in which the items appear.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="exerciseContainer">
      <h3>Exercise Seven:</h3>
      <span>
        This is a flexbox playground, the id of it is "exerciseSeven". There is no final objective here, your 
        objective is to play around with the different flex box options. The id's of the child elements are in them.
        Try using all of the flexbox ideas we have learned so far, including: justify-content, align-items, align-self,
        and flex-direction. Have fun!
      </span>
    </div>
    <div id="exerciseSeven">
      <div id="itemOne" class="items"><span class="itemSpan">This element's id is "itemOne"</span></div>
      <div id="itemTwo" class="items"><span class="itemSpan">This element's id is "itemTwo"</span></div>
      <div id="itemThree" class="items"><span class="itemSpan">This element's id is "itemThree"</span></div>
      <div id="itemFour" class="items"><span class="itemSpan">This element's id is "itemFour"</span></div>      
    </div>

      <h3>Extra Credit 1:</h3>

        There is a lot to flex box and it can become complicated, but through practice you can learn to quickly 
        adjust the positioning of your elements with ease. I recommend completing the "Flexbox Froggy" tutorial, 
        it will show you in depth how the flex box positioning system works: <a href="http://www.flexboxfroggy.com" target="_blank_">Flexbox Froggy</a>

      <h3>Extra Credit 2:</h3>
      <span>
        A new, native, CSS grid system has been introduced. It is called css-grid and can be used to make 
        positioning even faster and more precise. We will use css-grid in the full course, so it might be 
        nice to familiarize yourself with it now: <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/" target="_blank_">A Complete Guide to CSS Grid</a>
