## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

5. Navigate into the homework folder using your terminal.

6. Once you are in the homework folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `homework.js` to make the tests pass.
