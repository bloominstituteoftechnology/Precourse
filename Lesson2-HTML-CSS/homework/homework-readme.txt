This is the instructions for the homework for Lambda School's Pre-course Workshop, Lesson 2 - HTML/CSS Fundamentals.

Now that you have watched us create an HTML file and external style sheet you will do one of your own. 
You will be writing all of your code in homework.html found in this folder.
To view your HTML file, in your web browser select File-Open File- then select the homework.html file in this folder. 

I. Create a basic HTML page.
  A. Create the basic layout for an HTML page using html, head, and body.
  B. Add a title element and give your page the title of "[Your name]'s HTML homework".

    2. In the second div create:.

    3. In the third div create:
      * an an unordered list with two list items
      * an img tag in each list item linking to your favorite food. (Use google image search to find a photo, if you can't 
        use this address: "http://http://lorempixel.com/400/200/food/").

Extra credit:   
  In order to do some of this you will either need to have an understanding of CSS currently, or will need to 
  do some further homework, I recoomend the additional resources in the README or https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
  
  * Set the background of the entire page to an image
  * Center the div's on the page
  * Center all of the elements on the page
