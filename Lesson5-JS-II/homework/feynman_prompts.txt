For loops

Sometimes we want to run an instruction many times with the same or slightly
different values. For loops are a convenient way to avoid writing the same lines
of instructions many times in a row. We can put instructions inside a for statement,
and the program will repeatedly execute these instructions while the For loop is
"active." We are able to control For loops with the arguments that we provide them.
One of these arguments is a Boolean expression. Before each "loop," or before the 
code in the for block is executed, this Boolean expression is checked for truth,
and the loop is ended if the value is False. If the loop is executed successfully,
any instructions in the final argument of the For loop are executed. Using these
two arguments together is what allows us to count from 1 to 10, and to stop before
we reach 11;

&&, ||, and !

These are each examples of "operators", which are similar to the more familiar
arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). These operators should be used when a boolean
is the expected result of an instruction. The && operator is called "and," and
compares the values on the left and right of it. && will return True only if
both arguments are True, and False if not. || is the "or" operator, and also
requires two values to compare. || will return true if either of its arguments is
True, and will only return False if both arguments are False. ! is the "not"
operator, and is rare in that it only accepts a single argument. The ! operator
will return the opposite Boolean value of its argument, and is a convenient way
to make your instruction match the Boolean value expected by your other code.
