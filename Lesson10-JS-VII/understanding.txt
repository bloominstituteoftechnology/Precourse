==> Closure:
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer 
(enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has 
three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables 
defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer 
function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.

The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s 
variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters. Note that 
the inner function cannot call the outer function’s arguments 
object, however, even though it can call the outer function’s 
parameters directly.
