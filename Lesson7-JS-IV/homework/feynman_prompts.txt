Obects

Often when we are writing a program, we have a reason to take something from the
real world (an "Object") and use it in our code. An object is more than a number or
a sentence, it is something that can only be described. One way to do this is to make
a variable for each unique feature of the object, and use those variables in our 
instructions when we need to. This only works when we have only one of these objects, 
because we would be forced to make a choice: either make another copy of every variable
we had used to describe the first object, or replace the value of the each of those 
variables. The first means many lines of extra code, and the second means we will lose
the information from the first. Since this is a common problem, Objects were created
for programmers to use. An Object is used like a variable with many values, where
each value describes a feature of the object. These values are like variables, because
they have a name and a value, but are special in a few ways and have their own name.
They are called Properties. 

Properties

Objects represent ideas as well as things in the real world. Both of these need to be
described: A stone can be smooth or rough, and the tardy policy states that 5 minutes
lateness earns a disciplinary note. Programmers use Properties to describe their
objects. Properties are used like variables to store values under a chosen name, but
are different from variables because we have to look at the object they are tied to in
order to get to them. Languages treat properties like they belong to their object, so
functions and instructions that work with objects will be able to use their properties.

Methods

Methods are a special type of property. They contain a function in their value and are
used to describe actions that an object can perform. They receive similar special
treatment when compared to normal functions, like other properties.

For In Loop

For loops are used quite a bit to access all of an object's properties and execute code
for each of them. The most common use is with arrays, which are objects with a property
for each index. The "for...in" loop was created to make the boring For loop syntax more
readable. You provide it with a name for a variable that will be filled with each
each property value during the loop, and the name of a variable that is tied to the
object you want to loop through. 

Dot notation vs bracket notation

All programming languages are a way for programmers to communicate instructions to
a computer. These languages are interpreted for us by a translator so that they can be
understood by the computer. Each language has its own method of translating our code
into the instructions actually executed by the machine. Sometimes this means having
more than one way to do the same thing. In Javascript, this is true of accessing 
the properties of objects. There are two options, dot notation and bracket notation.
Dot notation looks like this: 

Object.property 

and bracket notation looks like this:

Object["property"]

both of these forms will return the value of the property. The difference between
them appears in complicated situations. The names of properties in Javascript are
actually Strings, and can contain unusual characters, such as [ ] ; . These will
cause Javascript to misinterpret our code when used with dot notation, and we are
required to use bracket notation instead. It can be helpful to think of dot notation
as a helpful shortcut that doesn't always work, and to memorize the bracket way of
accessing properties.
