1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects: allow you to contain a lot of different related data in one particular container

	* Properties: properties are values that are associated with a particular object

	* Methods: are functions inside of an object 

	* for in loop: lets you loop through an object 

	* Dot notation vs bracket notation: both call properties on an object. Dot notation can only identify properties that starts with a letter. Dot notation example: objectName.propertyName; With the Bracket notation the property only needs to be a string (fewer limitations with bracket notation). You can use variables to acess properties in an object with bracket notation. Bracket notation example: objectName[propertyName];
