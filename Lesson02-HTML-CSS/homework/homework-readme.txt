These are the instructions for the homework for Lesson 2 - HTML/CSS Fundamentals.

Now that you have watched us create an HTML file and external style sheet you will do one of your own. 
You will be writing all of your code in homework.html found in this folder.
To view your HTML file, in your web browser select File-Open File- then select the homework.html file in this folder. 

I. Create a basic HTML page.
  A. Create the basic layout for an HTML page using html, head, and body.
  B. Add a title element and give your page the title of "[Your name]'s HTML homework".
  C. In the body, create three divs.
    1. In the first div create:
      * an h1 element containing [Your name].
      * an h3 element containing "Lambda School".
      * an h4 element containing "HTML/CSS homework".
    2. In the second div create:.
      * a span element containing text describing your favorite food.
      * an 'a' element linking to your favorite restaurant.
    3. In the third div create:
      * an an unordered list with two list items
      * an img tag in each list item linking to your favorite food. (Use Google image search to find a photo, if you can't 
        use this address: "http://http://lorempixel.com/400/200/food/").

II. Add some style
  A. Add style tags to your HTML document.
  B. Give your third div the id "thirdDiv".
  C. Give your other divs the class "divClass".
  D. Give the span in your second div the id "spanId".
  E. Add a style rule to your h1 element changing the color of the text (pick from 
     here: https://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/color.html).
  F. Add a style rule to the img element giving it a width of 400px;
  G. Add a style rule to 'thirdDiv' changing the height to 600px and the width to 500px.
  H. Add a style rule to 'thirdDiv' changing the background color.
  I. Change the size of the font for 'spanId' to 18px.
  J. Give the id 'spanId' a margin of 50px.
  K. Give the id 'thirdDiv' a padding of 50px.
  L. Give the id 'thirdDiv' a border, any width color and style you choose.

III. Create an external style sheet and move all of our previous style rules into the new stylesheet.
  A. Create a file called styles.css in this folder.
  B. COPY all of your style rules to this new file. (Do not include the style tags!)
  C. Place: <!-- in front of your first style tag.
  D. Place: --> after your closing style tag.
  E. Add a link tag to your html that imports your new css file. 

IV. Add, Commit and push your work to your github account.

Extra credit:   
  In order to do some of this you will either need to have an understanding of CSS currently, or will need to 
  do some further homework, I recommend the additional resources in the README or https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
  
  * Set the background of the entire page to an image
  * Center the div's on the page
  * Center all of the elements on the page
  * Read about positioning and use the position rule in your styles
  * Read about flexbox and use flexbox to center all of the items on the page
